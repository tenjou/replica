# REPLICA

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/build-replica.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/build-replica)

Replica is small and configureless build tool for most common actions you will find while developing front end JavaScript applications or libraries.

#### Features
* Include all scripts automatically inside index html file
* Pack scripts into one file
* Minify packed files
* Realtime watching for added/removed files
* Timestamp changed scripts in index html file
* Simple embeded string syntax for requiring files/changing include order - such as "require <name>"

Replica approaches more classical way of building JavaScript projects by automatic file inclusion in HTML Index file for more speedy development and instantenous build time while developing projects.
Also supports optional custom require syntax to change include order without need to manage files yourself.

## Installation

```
npm install -g build-replica
```

## Usage

#### 1. Plug & play
Most simple approach while developing front end projects with HTML index file. 
By default this option will search for "index.html" file and include all JavaScript files that are inside folder and will watch for file changes.
```
build-replica
```
Equivalent to:
```
build-replica --input ./ --index index.html --watch --timestamp
```

#### 2. Customized development build
```
build-replica --input lib --input src --index index.html --watch --timestamp
```

#### 3. Production ready compilation
```
build-replica --input lib --input src --index index.html --uglify --timestamp
```

#### 4. Compile library
```
build-replica --input lib --concat build/my_package.js --uglify
```

## Custom include order
Replica supports optional way of changing file include order by specifying `require <filename_without_extension>` at the top of file content.

#### a.js
```
"require b";
```

Will make b.js to be included before a.js.

## Options

```
  --input <dir|file>                	Specify an input folder. Order they are defined in also will change order they are included.
  --index <file>           		The path to output index file.
  --watch						Look after file changes in set input folders.
  --concat <file=./package.js>	Specify that files should be concatenated inside one file.
  --uglify						Specify that concatenated file should be minified. Setting this will force --concat flag to true.
  --timestamp					Add timestamp to scripts inside index file.
```

## TODO

- Help inside cmd
- Add optional package syntax
- Custom input packages
- Download url dependencies inside cache
- Documentation generation
